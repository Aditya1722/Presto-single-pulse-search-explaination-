In the first line we assigning name to the block that if it is executed as a main prgram or module etc .

imported `hotshot` - used to profile the code block i.e statistical infos like running time and etc 

So in this block of the code we are just calling the main function as conditions under `if(0)` won`t be executed

This is the part of main fucntion in which they are defining list of options for users to use by using `optparse` python module  

End of completion we used `(opts, args) = parser.parse_args()` to tell `optparse` that we`re done

`parse_args()` returns two values:
* options, an object containing values for all of your optionsâ€”e.g. if --file takes a single string argument, then options.file will be the filename supplied by the user, or None if the user did not supply that option
* args, the list of positional arguments leftover after parsing options

Here 
`Action = store`tells to take the next argument and store it to your choosen destination
and the flags true/false  just to put the dest value to true or false`
`help` - use to give some info about the command 
`dest` - destination 

```

 else:

```
In this block of code `opts.globexp` is checking the variable if given any in command line . eg ` --globexp .txt `

usefft & dosearch are assigned to be true 

if `opts.xwin` is true then pgplot_device is assignned to "/XWIN" otherwise ""

chunklen ?

* assert statement is used to check if a condition is True, and if it's not, it raises an error.
* detrendfact ? (cheking if detrendfact have the values mentioned in code )
* dtrendlen is decided
* Then dtrendlen ,chunklen,fflten all are recalculated considering dtrendfact user input (next2_to_n is a lib imported from presto )
* blocks per chunk is devision of  chunkslen and dtrendlen
* overlap , worklen is defined and max_downfact and default are constant
* checking arg
*

    DMs.sort()

```

In this code block we are trying to read single pulse file(main objective ) 
245 and 246 , 249 , 255 ,

load all the info in cands (here doubt diff between cand and cand )

some condition and if that satisfies will store it as a candidate
`candiate` class is used to store that value in a candidate list ?

* Filenmbase we got from previous step is added with an extension `.inf` to extract the informatiom using `info.info()` and save it in `info`
* Then we extract dm info from info.dm and first add it in DMstr and then append DM values in `DMs`
* Then were extracting the info of `dt`(time step size) and `N`(no. of time bing )so we can get observation time(`obstime`)
* `maxwidth` is either given by you or default
* it checks if `maxwidth`(which you entered ) is > than 0 
  > if yes then compare it with each (`down_sample list` values)*`dt`  and if it is < than `maxwidth` than add it to the list of `downnfacts`
  > if no then store all the values which are less than the `max_downfact` which is already defined as 30

* `stds` - making 1D array of len numblock
de-trend the data one chunk at a time

* if `opts.fast`(usefaster method of detrending) is true then remove median values from chunks(chunk we`re copying is time data or frequency data )
  > quicker than more complex detrending methods.
*  if `opts.fast` is false then at every chunk we will use `scipy.signal.detrend(data,type'linear')`
